Trying out designs for the web. It goes to show that you can use to many options when trying to get something clean on the page.

I have been practicing with JQuery, adding classes, removing classes, hiding elements and so forth, testing to see the effectivness
of the different techniques.

As can be seen I have not really used Bootstrap, although it is available.
